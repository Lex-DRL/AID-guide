`you` keyword

triang brackets:
* 3 meanings
* it's not **a** citadel (a fortress of some medieval king), it's **THE** Citadel (a massive space station).

Why some CATs start with `Shepard.`

`prop:<val>` vs `prop<val>` = length versus accuracy (in Zaltys).

In Futureman, try `<< Shepard` (with space) instead of `<<Shepard`: it might tokenize better (former takes just one token).

If possible, try making such keywords that tokenize to a single token, especially in Griffin.

`_exp.John = John|Doe`
`${John}.*hair`

aliases: `moniker`, `<< Shepard called Janice Shepard, Shep>>>> << Shepard use alias Janice Shepard, Shep>>>>`
